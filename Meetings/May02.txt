To do's for next meeting: 

- Add prediction based on the suffix, which uses the same production rule as for retrieving the stem.

- Add production rule that attaches "sein" and "en" such that a new chunk is created that contains "seinen".

- The chunks for the possessee should make clear that they are of type picture. 

- Output the activation values for the picture chunks in the trace. 

- Create a script that reads out these values.

- Based on those values create a table with columns for time, activation value and picture chunks.
