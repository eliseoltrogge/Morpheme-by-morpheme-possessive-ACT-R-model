To do's for next meeting: 

- Add prediction based on the suffix, which uses the same production rule as for retrieving the stem

- Add production rule that attaches "sein" and "en" such that it retrieves "seinen" based on the stem and suffix 

- Output more information in the trace (look for the parameter in the documentation)

- Create a script that reads out the activation values

- Based on those values create a table with columns for time, activation value and picture chunks.
